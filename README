Script for converting Carter's google spreadsheet into
publication-quality plots compiling bb0n experiment information.

To create plots, you must:
* Export Carter's spreadsheet in tab-delimited format.  (Comma-delimited format can be accepted with a small modification to MakeReviewPlots.py, but is not ideal because Carter's notes include commas.)
* Run:
  python MakeReviewPlots.py <name of tab-delimited file>
* The output plots will be created in the working directory where you ran the script.
